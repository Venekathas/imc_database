These files depend on a database called IMC. Saved and hosted through XAMPP.

Each PHP is a separate page for hosting the reports generated from the database.

Database not available for upload in the interest of privacy for our clients.

Using XAMPP, one can load the Database tool, upload the database, and enable hosting through XAMPP. These files would be placed into
the XAMPP > HTDocs > IMC folder. When you navigate to the XAMPP Admin center, it brings you to the local host. Select the IMC folder and you have access to the site.

Each PHP file is accessible from the front page, and from inside each page. Some search and sort functions are displayed and operational. Everything else is for readability
of the database.
